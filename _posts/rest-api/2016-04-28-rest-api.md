### Use RESTful service URLs

Under REST principles, a URL identifies a resource. The following URL design patterns are considered REST best practices:

- URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
- Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
- Use HTTP methods (HTTP/1.1) to operate on these resources:
- Use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.

### Versioning

Example of an API URL that contains a version number:

```
GET /v1/path/to/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### Should
If an API URL does not contain a version number (anonymous version), then it should be understood that it always refers to the latest version.

### Formats
Allow users to request formats like JSON or XML, for example:
```
http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.xml
```
##### Recommended
Avoid URL designs deeper than resource/identifier/resource.

The three patterns of payload format encoding most frequently found in the wild are:

```
HTTP headers (e.g. Content-Type: and Accept:)
GET parameters (e.g. &format=json)
resource label (e.g. /foo.json)
```

### Good RESTful URL examples

##### List of magazines:

```
GET /api/v1/magazines.json HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### Filtering and sorting are server-side operations on resources:

```
GET /api/v1/magazines.json?year=2011&sort=desc HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### A single magazine in JSON format:

```
GET /api/v1/magazines/1234.json HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### All articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:

```
GET /api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### All articles in this magazine in XML format:

```
GET /api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.xml HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### Specify query parameters in a comma separated list:

```
GET /api/v1/magazines/1234.json?fields=title,subtitle,date HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### Add a new article to a particular magazine:

```
POST /api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

### Bad RESTful URL examples

##### Non-plural noun:

```
GET /magazine HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

```
GET /magazine/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### Verb in URL:

```
GET /magazine/1234/create HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

##### Filter outside of query string:

```
GET /magazines/2011/desc HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```


### Use versions

##### Never release an API without a version number.

Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’. For example:

Good: v1, v2, v3

Bad: v-1.1, v1.2, 1.3

Maintain APIs at least one version back.


### Use HTTP methods and status codes

Meaningful status codes helps consumers utilise your API.

##### GET /magazines
List all magazines contained within the /magazines resource

```
GET /magazines HTTP/1.1
Host: example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript
```

A response of “200 OK” indicating that the request has succeeded.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Vary: Accept
Content-Type: text/javascript

{...}
```

##### Status Codes:	

```
200 OK – no error
404 Not Found – the “magazines” resource does not exist
```

##### POST /magazines

Create new magazine within the /magazines resource

```
POST /magazines HTTP/1.1
Host: example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript

{...}
```

A response of “201 Created” indicates that the request has been fulfilled.

The URI of the new resource is provided in the response

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Vary: Accept
Content-Type: text/javascript

{ "id": "1234" }
```

### Batching results

If no limit is specified, return results with a default limit.

##### To get records 51 through 75 do this:

```
GET /magazines?limit=25&offset=50 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.gov.au
Accept: application/json, text/javascript

offset=50 means, ‘skip the first 50 records’

limit=25 means, ‘return a maximum of 25 records’
```


Information about record limits and total available count should also be included in the response. Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Vary: Accept
Content-Type: text/javascript

{
  "metadata": {
    "resultset": {
      "count": 227,
      "offset": 25,
      "limit": 25
    }
  },
  "results": [...]
```
