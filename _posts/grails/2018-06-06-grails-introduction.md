## Grails- Introduction
Grails is a web framework based on Groovy and Java which can be deployed into existing Java web servers, e.g., Tomcat or Jetty.

Grails allows to quickly create web applications; its scaffolding capabilities let you create a new project within few minutes. Grails is based on the convention over configuration idea which allows the application to auto-wire itself based on naming schemes (instead of using configuration files, e.g, XML files).
