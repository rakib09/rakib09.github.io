## Google Play Service on Genymotion

For intellectual property reasons, Google Play Services are not included by default in Genymotion virtual devices. However, if you really need them, you can use the packages provided by OpenGapps. Simply follow these steps:

- Genymotion 2.10 is out! And it comes with a 1-click installer for Google Apps
- Simply [download and install Genymotion 2.10](http://genymotion.com/download) and a new “Open GApps” widget will be available in your toolbar. Click it and it’ll do the rest!
- Visit [opengapps.org](http://www.opengapps.org)
- Select x86 as platform
- Choose the Android version corresponding to your virtual device
- Select nano as variant
- Download the zip file
- Drag & Drop the zip installer in new Genymotion virtual device (2.7.2 and above only)
- Follow the pop-up instructions


Please note Genymobile Inc. and Genymotion assume no liability whatsoever resulting from the download, install and use of Google Play Services within your virtual devices. You are solely responsible for the use and assume all liability related thereto. Moreover, we disclaim any warranties of any kind for a particular purpose regarding the compatibility of the OpenGapps packages with any version of Genymotion
