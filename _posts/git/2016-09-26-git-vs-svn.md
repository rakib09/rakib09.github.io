## Git vs SVN
1. Git is a distributed VCS; SVN is a non-distributed VCS.
2. Git has a centralized server and repository; SVN does not have a centralized server or repository.
3. The content in Git is stored as metadata; SVN stores files of content.
4. Git branches are easier to work with than SVN branches.
5. Git has better content protection than SVN.
6. Git is distributed under GNU, and its maintenance overseen by Junio Hamano; Apache Subversion, or SVN, is distributed under the open source license.


The key difference is that it is decentralized. Imagine you are a developer on the road, you develop on your laptop and you want to have source control so that you can go back 3 hours.

With Subversion, you have a Problem: The SVN Repository may be in a location you can't reach (in your company, and you don't have internet at the moment), you cannot commit. If you want to make a copy of your code, you have to literally copy/paste it.

With Git, you do not have this problem. Your local copy is a repository, and you can commit to it and get all benefits of source control. When you regain connectivity to the main repository, you can commit against it.
