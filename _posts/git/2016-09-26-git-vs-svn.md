## Git vs SVN
1. Git is a distributed VCS; SVN is a non-distributed VCS.
2. Git has a centralized server and repository; SVN does not have a centralized server or repository.
3. The content in Git is stored as metadata; SVN stores files of content.
4. Git branches are easier to work with than SVN branches.
5. Git has better content protection than SVN.
6. Git is distributed under GNU, and its maintenance overseen by Junio Hamano; Apache Subversion, or SVN, is distributed under the open source license.
