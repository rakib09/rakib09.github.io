In summary, an adapter helps two incompatible interfaces to work together.Here, we have two incompatible interfaces : MediaPlayer and MediaPackage. MP3 class is an implementation of the MediaPlayer interface and we have VLC and MP4 as implementations of the MediaPackage interface. We want to use MediaPackage implementations as MediaPlayer instances. So, we need to create an adapter to help to work with two incompatible classes.The Adapter will be named FormatAdapter and must implement the MediaPlayer interface. Furthermore, the FormatAdapter class must have a reference to MediaPackage, the incompatible interface.public interface MediaPlayer { void play(String filename);}public interface MediaPackage { void playFile(String filename);}public class MP3 implements MediaPlayer { @Override public void play(String filename) {    System.out.println(\"Playing MP3 File \" + filename); }}public class MP4 implements MediaPackage { @Override public void playFile(String filename) {    System.out.println(\"Playing MP4 File \" + filename); }}public class VLC implements MediaPackage { @Override public void playFile(String filename) {    System.out.println(\"Playing VLC File \" + filename); }}Here, we want to use VLC and MP4 instances as MediaPlayer instances.

        "content": "Template method design patternTemplate method defines the steps to execute an algorithm and it can provide default implementation that might be common for all or some of the subclasses.Let’s understand this pattern with an example, suppose we want to provide an algorithm to build a house. The steps need to be performed to build a house are – building foundation, building pillars, building walls and windows. The important point is that the we can’t change the order of execution because we can’t build windows before building the foundation. So in this case we can create a template method that will use different methods to build the house.Now building the foundation for a house is same for all type of houses, whether its a wooden house or a glass house. So we can provide base implementation for this, if subclasses want to override this method, they can but mostly it’s common for all the types of houses.To make sure that subclasses don’t override the template method, we should make it final.package com.journaldev.design.template;public abstract class HouseTemplate {\t//template method, final so subclasses can't override\tpublic final void buildHouse(){\t\tbuildFoundation();\t\tbuildPillars();\t\tbuildWalls();\t\tbuildWindows();\t\tSystem.out.println(\"House is built.\");\t}\t//default implementation\tprivate void buildWindows() {\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Building Glass Windows\");\t}\t//methods to be implemented by subclasses\tpublic abstract void buildWalls();\tpublic abstract void buildPillars();\tprivate void buildFoundation() {\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Building foundation with cement,iron rods and sand\");\t}}package com.journaldev.design.template;public class WoodenHouse extends HouseTemplate {\t@Override\tpublic void buildWalls() {\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Building Wooden Walls\");\t}\t@Override\tpublic void buildPillars() {\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Building Pillars with Wood coating\");\t}}package com.journaldev.design.template;public class GlassHouse extends HouseTemplate {\t@Override\tpublic void buildWalls() {\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Building Glass Walls\");\t}\t@Override\tpublic void buildPillars() {\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Building Pillars with glass coating\");\t}}package com.journaldev.design.template;public class HousingClient {\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\t\t\t\tHouseTemplate houseType = new WoodenHouse();\t\t\t\t//using template method\t\thouseType.buildHouse();\t\tSystem.out.println(\"************\");\t\t\t\thouseType = new GlassHouse();\t\t\t\thouseType.buildHouse();\t}}Output of the above program is:Building foundation with cement,iron rods and sandBuilding Pillars with Wood coatingBuilding Wooden WallsBuilding Glass WindowsHouse is built.************Building foundation with cement,iron rods and sandBuilding Pillars with glass coatingBuilding Glass WallsBuilding Glass WindowsHouse is built.Template Method Design Pattern in JDK  All non-abstract methods of java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer.  All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.    Template Method Design Pattern Important Points    Template method should consists of certain steps whose order is fixed and for some of the methods, implementation differs from base class to subclass. Template method should be final.  Most of the times, subclasses calls methods from super class but in template pattern, superclass template method calls methods from subclasses, this is known as Hollywood Principle – “don’t call us, we’ll call you.”.  Methods in base class with default implementation are referred as Hooks and they are intended to be overridden by subclasses, if you want some of the methods to be not overridden, you can make them final, for example in our case we can make buildFoundation() method final because if we don’t want subclasses to override it.Source: JournalDev",

The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.What is SDLC?SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.The following figure is a graphical representation of the various stages of a typical SDLC.SDLC ModelsThere are various software development life cycle models defined and designed which are followed during the software development process. These models are also referred as Software Development Process Models”. Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development.Following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry &amp;miuns;  Waterfall Model  Iterative Model  Spiral Model  V-Model  Big Bang ModelOther related methodologies are Agile Model, RAD Model, Rapid Application Development and Prototyping Models.",

        "content": "SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) PrinciplesA service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any product, vendor or technology.SOA just makes it easier for software components over various networks to work with each other.Web services which are built as per the SOA architecture tend to make web service more independent. The web services themselves can exchange data with each other and because of the underlying principles on which they are created, they don’t need any sort of human interaction and also don’t need any code modifications. It ensures that the web services on a network can interact with each other seamlessly.SOA is based on some key principles which are mentioned belowStandardized Service ContractServices adhere to a service description. A service must have some sort of description which describes what the service is about. This makes it easier for client applications to understand what the service does.Loose CouplingLess dependency on each other. This is one of the main characteristics of web services which just states that there should be as less dependency as possible between the web services and the client invoking the web service. So if the service functionality changes at any point in time, it should not break the client application or stop it from working.Service AbstractionServices hide the logic they encapsulate from the outside world. The service should not expose how it executes its functionality; it should just tell the client application on what it does and not on how it does it.Service ReusabilityLogic is divided into services with the intent of maximizing reuse. In any development company re-usability is a big topic because obviously one wouldn’t want to spend time and effort building the same code again and again across multiple applications which require them. Hence, once the code for a web service is written it should have the ability work with various application types.Service AutonomyServices should have control over the logic they encapsulate. The service knows everything on what functionality it offers and hence should also have complete control over the code it contains.Service StatelessnessIdeally, services should be stateless. This means that services should not withhold information from one state to the other. This would need to be done from either the client application. An example can be an order placed on a shopping site. Now you can have a web service which gives you the price of a particular item. But if the items are added to a shopping cart and the web page navigates to the page where you do the payment, the responsibility of the price of the item to be transferred to the payment page should not be done by the web service. Instead, it needs to be done by the web application.Service DiscoverabilityServices can be discovered (usually in a service registry). We have already seen this in the concept of the UDDI, which performs a registry which can hold information about the web service.Service ComposabilityServices break big problems into little problems. One should never embed all functionality of an application into one single service but instead, break the service down into modules each with a separate business functionality.Service InteroperabilityServices should use standards that allow diverse subscribers to use the service. In web services, standards as XML and communication over HTTP is used to ensure it conforms to this principle.",

Multiple students can associate with single teacher and single student can associate with multiple teachers, but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. Both can be created and deleted independently.Aggregationis a specialised form of Association where all objects have their own lifecycle, but there is ownership and child objects can not belong to another parent object.Let’s take an example of Department and teacher. A single teacher can not belong to multiple departments, but if we delete the department, the teacher object will not be destroyed. We can think about it as a “has-a” relationship.Compositionis again specialised form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death” relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have its lifecycle and if parent object is deleted, all child objects will also be deleted.Let’s take again an example of relationship between House and Rooms. House can contain multiple rooms - there is no independent life of room and any room can not belong to two different houses. If we delete the house - room will automatically be deleted.Let’s take another example relationship between Questions and Options. Single questions can have multiple options and option can not belong to multiple questions. If we delete the questions, options will automatically be deleted.",

This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this v0.10.35.        Test NPM. To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print NPM’s version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.28        Create a test file and run it. A simple way to test that node.js works is to create a JavaScript file: name it hello.js, and just add the code console.log(‘Node is installed!’);. To run the code simply open your command line program, navigate to the folder where you save the file and type node hello.js. This will start Node and run the code in the hello.js file. You should see the output Node is installed!.      How to Update Node and NPMThis is the new best way to upgrade npm on Windows.  Run PowerShell as AdministratorSet-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Forcenpm install -g npm-windows-upgradenpm-windows-upgradeNote: Do not run npm i -g npm. Instead use npm-windows-upgrade to update npm going forward. Also if you run the NodeJS installer, it will replace the node version.  Upgrades npm in-place, where node installed it.  Easy updating, update to the latest by running npm-windows-upgrade -p -v latest.  Does not modify the default path.  Does not change the default global package location.  Allows easy upgrades and downgrades.  Officially recommended by the NPM team.  A list of versions matched between NPM and NODE (https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) - but you will need to download NODE INSTALLER and run that to update node (https://nodejs.org/en/)",

Low cohesion is when a class does a lot of jobs that don’t have much in common.Let’s take this example:You have a class that adds two numbers, but the same class creates a window displaying the result. This is a low cohesive class because the window and the adding operation don’t have much in common. The window is the visual part of the program and the adding function is the logic behind it.To create a high cohesive solution, you would have to create a class Window and a class Sum. The window will call Sum’s method to get the result and display it. This way you will develop separately the logic and the GUI of your application.",

So Bill Pugh came up with a different approach to create the Singleton class using a inner static helper class.package com.journaldev.singleton;public class BillPughSingleton {    private BillPughSingleton(){}        private static class SingletonHelper{        private static final BillPughSingleton INSTANCE = new BillPughSingleton();    }        public static BillPughSingleton getInstance(){        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;    }}When the singleton class is loaded, SingletonHelper class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance method, this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance.This is the most widely used approach for Singleton class as it doesn’t require synchronization. I am using this approach in many of my projects and it’s easy to understand and implement also.Advantage of Singleton design patternSaves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single instance is reused again and again.Usage of Singleton design patternSingleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications. It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.Source: JournalDev",

So from a HashSet perspective, you can add as many new String(“aardvark”) as you want, they will all be considered the same (because new String(“aardvark”).equals(new String(“aardvark”)) is true) and only one will be added.Whereas two different WrappedString instances will not be equal, even if the strings they contain are equal (because new WrappedString(“aardvark”).equals(new WrappedString(“aardvark”)) is false), so the set will not consider them as duplicates.If you want a behaviour similar to String, you need to implement equals and hashcode in your WrappedString class",

If you use interface than in future if the new implementation is shipped then you are not required to change your program. For example, any program written using List will work as expected whether you pass a LinkedList, Vector or ArrayList, because they all implements List interface, they obey the contract exposed by List interface.The only difference comes in performance, which is actually on of the driver for change. In short, if you program using interface, tomorrow if a better implementation of your interface is available then you can switch to that without making nay further change on the client side (part of the program which uses that interface).ArrayList vs LinkListPerformance  :  Performance of ArrayList and LinkedList depends on the type of operationa. get(int index) or search operation :  ArrayList get(int index) operation runs in constant time i.e O(1)  while LinkedList get(int index) operation run time is O(n) .b. insert() or add(Object) operation :  Insertions in LinkedList are generally fast as compare to ArrayList.                   ArrayList      LinkedList                  Implementation      Resizable Array      Douby-LinkedList              ReverseIterator      No      Yes , descendingIterator()              Initial Capacity      10      Constructs empty list              get(int) operation      Fast      Slow in comparision              add(int) operation      Slow in comparision      Fast              Memory Overhead      No      Yes      ",

For that we use JavaScript or any other JavaScript library like jQuery.Angular also provides some help in this context. We can validate a form and see that the required validations work correctly. It provides different objects to the form. They are very helpful while validating forms:$pristine: It will be TRUE, if the user has not interacted with the form yet$dirty: It will be TRUE, if the user has already interacted with the form.$valid: It will be TRUE, if all containing form and controls are valid$invalid: It will be TRUE, if at least one containing form and control is invalid.$error: Is an object hash, containing references to all invalid controls or forms, where:     keys are validation tokens (error names)    values are arrays of controls or forms that are invalid with given error.There are some built in validation tokens, that can help in validating form:emailmaxmaxlengthminminlengthnumberpatternrequiredurlIn accordance with these AngularJS also provides corresponding CSS classes for them. We can use them for validation purpose.ng-pristineng-dirtyng-validng-invalidLets see how we can use them.

You can probably use JavaScript file upload feature of AWS S3. This is simple three step feature as described below:Step 1 : In the head section of your page include javascript sdk and specify your keys like this:Step 2 : Now create a simple html form with a file input.&lt;form id=\"fileUploadForm\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"file\" id=\"file\" value=\"dataFile\" required=\"\"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;Step 3 : Now upload your input file to S3$(\"#fileUploadForm\").submit(function() {var bucket = new AWS.S3({params: {Bucket: 'BUCKET_NAME'}});var fileChooser = document.getElementById('file');var file = fileChooser.files[0];if (file) {var params = {Key: 'FILE_NAME', ContentType: file.type, Body: file};bucket.upload(params).on('httpUploadProgress', function(evt) {console.log(\"Uploaded :: \" + parseInt((evt.loaded * 100) / evt.total)+'%');}).send(function(err, data) {alert(\"File uploaded successfully.\");});}return false;});To upload the file successfully, you need to enable CORS configuration on S3.Generally, it is not advisable to display your keys directly on page, so you can use Amazon Cognito or web identity federation feature.Using Cognito service&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;title&gt;AWS S3 File Upload&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;script src=\"https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-2.1.12.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;    &lt;input type=\"file\" id=\"file-chooser\" /&gt;    &lt;button id=\"upload-button\"&gt;Upload to S3&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;div id=\"results\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;    AWS.config.region = 'ap-south-1'; // 1.

Spring Boot provides live reload (hot swap) of application out of the box using the following dependency.&lt;dependency&gt;    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-devtools&lt;/artifactId&gt;    &lt;optional&gt;true&lt;/optional&gt;&lt;/dependency&gt;But it didn’t live reload the application/container, and the hot deployment didn’t work for changes. Further researching found that following changes needed to be done in order the hot deployment to be worked correctly.      Open the Settings –&gt; Build-Execution-Deployment –&gt; Compiler    and enable the Make Project Automatically.        Then press ctrl+shift+A and search for the registry. In the registry, make the following configuration enabled.     compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running            Reload Static content (html, css, js)    Add this configuration to your Spring Boot Maven Plugin:     &lt;configuration&gt;     &lt;addResources&gt;true&lt;/addResources&gt; &lt;/configuration&gt;            Restart the IDE.  That’s it! Now the hot deployment works, and you don’t have to restart manually after each and every change.In case of spring boot with thymeleaf there may be problem in reload html, css, js etc.In this case, we need to change run configuration in intelij like bellow:",

Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data.\"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”  -- Tom Mitchell, Carnegie Mellon University So if you want your program to predict, for example, traffic patterns at a busy intersection (task T), you can run it through a machine learning algorithm with data about past traffic patterns (experience E) and, if it has successfully “learned”, it will then do better at predicting future traffic patterns (performance measure P).ML solves problems that cannot be solved by numerical means alone. To break down the definition for easier understanding I should mention some factors that we should know as follows:  Method means technique or way to do  Data means set of information  Existing data means data already we have for any task.  Algorithm - Step by step set of operations/command to be performed  Automatically – Something is done or gained without working again.  Model - Data schema that learn from data iteratively",

        "content": "  What is difference between Heap and Stack Memory?Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it. Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables to objects in heap space.Memory management in the stack is done in LIFO manner whereas it’s more complex in Heap memory because it’s used globally.For a detailed explanation with a sample program, read Java Heap vs Stack Memory.  Java is Pass by Value or Pass by Reference?Java is Pass by Value and Not Pass by ReferenceFirst of all we should understand what is meant by pass by value or pass by reference.      Pass by Value: The method parameter values are copied to another variable and then the copied object is passed, that’s why it’s called pass by value.        Pass by Reference: An alias or reference to the actual parameter is passed to the method, that’s why it’s called pass by reference.  Example: Let’s say we have a class Balloon like below.package com.journaldev.test;public class Balloon {\tprivate String color;\tpublic Balloon(){}\t\tpublic Balloon(String c){\t\tthis.color=c;\t}\t\tpublic String getColor() {\t\treturn color;\t}\tpublic void setColor(String color) {\t\tthis.color = color;\t}}package com.journaldev.test;public class Test {\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\t\tBalloon red = new Balloon(\"Red\"); //memory reference 50\t\tBalloon blue = new Balloon(\"Blue\"); //memory reference 100\t\t\t\tswap(red, blue);\t\tSystem.out.println(\"red color=\"+red.getColor());\t\tSystem.out.println(\"blue color=\"+blue.getColor());\t\t\t\tfoo(blue);\t\tSystem.out.println(\"blue color=\"+blue.getColor());\t\t\t}\tprivate static void foo(Balloon balloon) { //baloon=100\t\tballoon.setColor(\"Red\"); //baloon=100\t\tballoon = new Balloon(\"Green\"); //baloon=200\t\tballoon.setColor(\"Blue\"); //baloon = 200\t}\t//Generic swap method\tpublic static void swap(Object o1, Object o2){\t\tObject temp = o1;\t\to1=o2;\t\to2=temp;\t}}Output:red color=Redblue color=Blueblue color=Red  Write a program to print all permutations of String?This is a tricky question and we need to use recursion to find all the permutations of a String, for example “AAB” permutations will be “AAB”, “ABA” and “BAA”.We also need to use Set to make sure there are no duplicate values.      What is platform independence?Java code is compiled to class file &amp; this class file can run to all ooperating system.Hence Java is platform independent.    Why java is so popular?          Java is platform independent      Object Oriented      Robust      Secure programming Language        Difference between C++ &amp; java:          Pointers: C++ has Pointers But There is no pointers in java      Structures &amp; Unions: in C++ ==&gt; Class (Structure + methods) &amp; Object in Java      Memory management vs Garbage Collection in C++ ==&gt; Class &amp; Object in Java            ",

Suppose I have a string variable that have characters, converting this variable into digit will occur NumberFormatException.String s=\"abc\";  int i=Integer.parseInt(s);//NumberFormatException  4) Scenario where ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occursIf you are inserting any value in the wrong index, it would result ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as shown below:int a[]=new int[5];  a[10]=50; //ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException  Java Exception Handling KeywordsThere are 5 keywords used in java exception handling.trycatchfinallythrowthrowsThe JVM firstly checks whether the exception is handled or not. If exception is not handled, JVM provides a default exception handler that performs the following tasks:  Prints out exception description.  Prints the stack trace (Hierarchy of methods where the exception occurred).  Causes the program to terminate.But if exception is handled by the application programmer, normal flow of the application is maintained i.e. rest of the code is executed.Java finally block  Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection, stream etc.  Java finally block is always executed whether exception is handled or not.  Java finally block isFor each try block there can be zero or more catch blocks, but only one finally block.Java Exception propagationAn exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught, it drops down the call stack to the previous method,If not caught there, the exception again drops down to the previous method, and so on until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack.This is called exception propagation.class TestExceptionPropagation1{           void m(){             int data=50/0;           }           void n(){             m();           }           void p(){            try{             n();            }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(\"exception handled\");}           }           public static void main(String args[]){            TestExceptionPropagation1 obj=new TestExceptionPropagation1();            obj.p();            System.out.println(\"normal flow...\");           }         }                Output:exception handled              normal flow... By default Unchecked Exceptions are forwarded in calling chain (propagated).By default, Checked Exceptions are not forwarded in calling chain (propagated).Program which describes that checked exceptions are not propagated    class TestExceptionPropagation2{        void m(){          throw new java.io.IOException(\"device error\");//checked exception        }        void n(){          m();        }        void p(){         try{          n();         }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(\"exception handeled\");}        }        public static void main(String args[]){         TestExceptionPropagation2 obj=new TestExceptionPropagation2();         obj.p();         System.out.println(\"normal flow\");        }      }          Output:Compile Time Errorava throws keywordThe Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception so it is better for the programmer to provide the exception handling code so that normal flow can be maintained.Exception Handling is mainly used to handle the checked exceptions. If there occurs any unchecked exception such as NullPointerException, it is programmers fault that he is not performing check up before the code being used.Syntax of java throwsreturn_type method_name() throws exception_class_name{  //method code  }  Which exception should be declaredAns) checked exception only, because:unchecked Exception: under your control so correct your code.error: beyond your control e.g. you are unable to do anything if there occurs VirtualMachineError or StackOverflowError.Difference between throw and throws in Java            No.      throw      throws                  1)      Java throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.      Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception.              2)      Checked exception cannot be propagated using throw only.      Checked exception can be propagated with throws.              3)      Throw is followed by an instance.      Throws is followed by class.              4)      Throw is used within the method.      Throws is used with the method signature.              5)      You cannot throw multiple exceptions.      You can declare multiple exceptions e.g. public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.      Difference between final, finally and finalizeThere are many differences between final, finally and finalize. A list of differences between final, finally and finalize are given below:            No.      final      finally      finalize                  1)      Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable.      Final class can’t be inherited, final method can’t be overridden and final variable value can’t be changed.      Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.\tFinalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.              2)      Final is a keyword.      Finally is a block.      Finalize is a method.

Use HTTP methods (HTTP/1.1) to operate on these resources:  Use HTTP response status codes to represent the outcome of operations on resources.VersioningExample of an API URL that contains a version number:GET /v1/path/to/resource HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptShouldIf an API URL does not contain a version number (anonymous version), then it should be understood that it always refers to the latest version.FormatsAllow users to request formats like JSON or XML, for example:http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.jsonhttp://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.xmlRecommendedAvoid URL designs deeper than resource/identifier/resource.The three patterns of payload format encoding most frequently found in the wild are:HTTP headers (e.g. Content-Type: and Accept:)GET parameters (e.g. &amp;format=json)resource label (e.g. /foo.json)Good RESTful URL examplesList of magazines:GET /api/v1/magazines.json HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptFiltering and sorting are server-side operations on resources:GET /api/v1/magazines.json?year=2011&amp;sort=desc HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptA single magazine in JSON format:GET /api/v1/magazines/1234.json HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptAll articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:GET /api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptAll articles in this magazine in XML format:GET /api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.xml HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptSpecify query parameters in a comma separated list:GET /api/v1/magazines/1234.json?fields=title,subtitle,date HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptAdd a new article to a particular magazine:POST /api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptBad RESTful URL examplesNon-plural noun:GET /magazine HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptGET /magazine/1234 HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptVerb in URL:GET /magazine/1234/create HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptFilter outside of query string:GET /magazines/2011/desc HTTP/1.1Host: www.example.gov.auAccept: application/json, text/javascriptUse versionsNever release an API without a version number.Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’.

Here is what worked for me on the Amazon EC2 instance:To install a MySQL Server  First step is to of course ssh into the EC2 instance  Then, at a command prompt, use the following command to install MySQL Server:sudo yum install mysql-serverWhen you are prompted, type ‘y’.To start the installed MySQL Server  Start mysql, and configure it to start up automatically on reboot.sudo chkconfig mysqld onsudo service mysqld startYou would see a response like the following.Starting mysqldConfiguring newly installed MySQL Server      To update the password of root user do the following:         mysqladmin -u root password [your_new_pwd]            To create a database do the following:         mysqladmin -u root -p create [your_new_db]When you are prompted for a password, type [your_new_pwd]. Well that’s it. There rest of the MySQL functionality is as usual. For more details on other functionalities please use the MySQL website.  mysql -u root -pUsing MySQL Externally  If you need to access MySQL from another server, then you need to execute these following additional steps.First off, create a MySQL user who can connect from any type of host using the following SQL:    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theuser'@'localhost'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theuser'@'localhost'CREATE USER 'theuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '[your_pwd]'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'theuser'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTIONGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' identified by “yourpasswordhere”;        Next, from the AWS Management Console find the Security Group that you assigned to your instance during set-up and add ‘MySQL’ to the group. You can also manually add port 3306. Save and whoala ready to go!Source: Link",
